#Networking Projects

Basics of Networking (Project 1)- Created EC2 instances, created security groups, created a VPC, internet gateway, route table, associated the security group, and modified security groups inbound and outbound rules. Built and managed complex networks using services such as VPC, Elastic Load Balancing, Direct connect and Route 53. 

Introduction to VPC (Project 2)- Created the VPC with the wizard and without the wizard. Found that the wizard was a more convenient option while custom VPC was more in the user's control. Created an application in Elastic Beanstalk. 

Elastic Load Balancing (Project 3)- Created two instances in 2 different Availability in the default VPC. Installed Tomcat by accessing instances with the use of PUTTY. Using WinSCP, created a load balancer and configured target groups. The sample application was accessed using the ELastic Load Balancers DNS name. 

Auto Scaling (Project 4)- Solidified the concept of vertical and horizontal scaling. Created an auto scaling group and configured manual and automated scaling.

Amazon Route 53 (Project 5)- Registered a domain in the AWS Management Console. Created an environment in AWS Elastic Beanstalk and configured Route 53 for a web application. 

AWS Direct Connect (Project 6)- Analyzed how to start out with Direct connect using private and public virtual interfaces. 

Security Best Practices (Project 7)- Implemented the shared responsibility model between AWS and the customer to make the environment secure. Configured the IAM and the multi-factor authentication for the AWS root account. Analyzed the difference between Security Groups and NACLs. 

Troubleshooting (Project 8)- Gave solutions to issues that can occur during day-to-day management of some AWS resources.
